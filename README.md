![SELAMAT PAGI](https://github.com/xdefrag/xdefrag/raw/master/selamatpagi.png)

Random developer from random point on the map.

Recently moved to SourceHut, find me if you interested in this kind of stuff: [sr.ht](https://git.sr.ht/~xdefrag).  
  
Why? Because it not requires js to work with. That's a big point for me.  
  
If you interested in degeneracy and software development = [track me on fediverse](https://xdefrag.dev).
